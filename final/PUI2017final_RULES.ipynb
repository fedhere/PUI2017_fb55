    "**Grading** Generally each step outlined in the instructions earns you 10 points (unless specified otherwise) or less for being done partially or not entirely correctly. There are 12 tasks.  Your submission will be downgraded 25% of the grade if the notebook does not run. The maximum number of points that one can obtain in the end is 100. Largely the grading will be on the output products: your tables and plots, and your comments. I will inspect code patches, and look at code where the output is not right to see what was incorrect and grade accordingly. The patches of code I inspect must be PEP8 compliant. I will grade the rendered notebook and then try to run it. You will have points taken off if your notebook does not run from top to end. You will have points taken off for PEP8 violations (see below). The extra credit tasks are more open ended, and the grading is therefore more subjective."

Since this problem is conceived by me for your final there is no such thing as \"copying the solution\". You are not going to be penalized for researching and using code that is relevant to obtain your solution (this of course does not apply to researching from your classmates codes.

You can use the environmental variable PUIDATA to point to the data that is stored there, or you can use SQL, urls, APIs, the data facility. If you download data the lines of code that download the data should be in the notebook. When not possible give details on what you downloaded, the relevant URLs and options you had to go through and instructions on how to reproduce it and obtain the same file as comments in your notebook.\n"

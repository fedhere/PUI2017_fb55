### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

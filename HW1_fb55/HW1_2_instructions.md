# Assignment 2: 

**Set up your environment:**

1. create a directory on your computer or on your workspace on ADRF called PUI2017. 

2. create an environmental variable PUI2017 that points to that directory (the full directory path starting with /home on a linux box, and with /Users on a mac) so that typing 

```
echo $PUI2017
```
returns the full path to the directory. Save  it in your .bashrc (linux) or .bash_profile (OS X) so that every time you open a new terminal the terminal knows what the $PUI2017 env var is set to.
create an alias such that typing 

```
pui2017
```
takes you to that directory (hint: the alias should use the cd command). Use the env. variable $PUI2017 to do so. 

Take a screenshot of your .bashrc/.bash_profile file where one can see the alias and env. variable you created. Type this series of commands on the terminal:

``` 
pwd

pui2017

pwd
```
Take a screenshot of your terminal that shows this series of commands and their output. 

Once your environment is set up go to github online and CREATE A NEW GITHUB REPO CALLED PUI2017_\<NYUid\> ( this for me would be PUI2017_fb55: https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55 ). Follow the github directions to create a repository on the command line on your local machine.  Notice that in this case you are working in the reverse order compared to the lab: you create the first instance of the repository on the remote server (on the web) and then you create a local repo to link to it on your machine. Follow the steps indicated by github to create the repo, a README.md file, and to link the online and local repos. 

Now modify your README.md file: edit the copy on your machine to have it describe what you did to set up your enviroment and upload the screenshots I directed you to take above, so that they are displayed in your README.md (like in the image below). The README.md is a “markdown”file. To see what the syntax to upload an image in a markdown file, or in general to format the text, you can look at the README.md file in my PUI2015_fbianco repository (link above, and image below) and if you look at the raw file by clicking the Raw button on the top right you can see the syntax. 
Remember that you also need to upload the images in your remote directory for them to be displayed in your README! just like any file you add them by git add and git commit, git push.

Your repository should automatically show the images

My bash_profile is complicated. Yours will likely be shorter and simpler. But in mine you should be able to spot the export line and the alias line for PUI2017.


NOTE: after you modify your .bashrc or .bash_profile you will have to rerun it: 
```
source .bashrc 
```

for the new set up to be incorporated in your environment. However, every new bash terminal you open will automatically read the .bashrc/.bash_profile and know about your new alias/env variables

# ASSIGNED READING:

[Don't use Hadoop - your data isn't that big, Chris Stucchio](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html)


# Submission Info:

Work in groups as usal, and you are encouraged to work in groups. Create a HW11_ directory in your PUI2016_ repository. Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to.

Submit Assignment as notebooks. Please dont just download my notebook, leave instructions in and fill in code cells: make it a presentation, comment on what you see, in English, with full sentences, and use critical thinking!!

Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work (there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.

**Assignment 1 :**


Follow notebook instructions. There are many buisiness datasets that need to be downloaded and that takes time. Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering. Dont start at the last minute!


**Assignment 2 :**

Submit your iclassKMeans notebook based of the skeleton we created in class, adding a loop to optimize the clustering and rendering it as an animation within the notebook. 
Refer to [this notebook for the setup](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/Lab11_fb55/inclassKmeans2017AM-partial.ipynb) (which goes as far as we went in class) and generate the series of plots in the last cell rendered as an animation. 

You can also see [here how to save animations as gifs](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/Lab11_fb55/animationExample.ipynb)

**your animation must render when the graders run the notebook**

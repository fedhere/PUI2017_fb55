    "# Investigation of taxi tipping behavior with income\n",
    "\n",
    "The NYC taxi data is publicly accessible since 2009. There are, consequently, many data-driven studies, time series analyses, geospatial analyses, and a commonly attempted task is the prediction of the amount tipped. Many of these studies suggest a relation between the socioeconomic characteristics of the passenger and their tipping habits. This analysis is designed to test the hypothesis that the income of the passenger is related to the passenger tipping behavior (tipping generosity).\n",
